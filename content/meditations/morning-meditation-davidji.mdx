## Before the World Rushes In

How do you start your morning? If you're like most of us, the alarm goes off and within seconds you're reaching for your phone — scrolling through emails, checking notifications, scanning the news. Before your feet even hit the floor, you've already been pulled into the demands of the day. Work deadlines, the kids' schedules, the endless to-do list — it all floods in before you've had a single conscious breath.

But what if you gave yourself a different kind of start?

Taking just 10 to 30 minutes each morning to sit quietly, breathe, and set an intention can completely shift the trajectory of your day. Instead of reacting to the world from the moment you wake up, you get to *choose* how you meet it. A peaceful morning practice doesn't require anything elaborate — just a willingness to pause before the rush begins.

## A Guided Morning Practice

In this 25-minute guided meditation, davidji helps you get comfortable, settle in, and start your morning with a powerful trajectory. You'll explore sacred questions and use intention setting to make the most of your day ahead.

## Why Morning Matters

The first moments of your day set the tone for everything that follows. When you jump straight into the chaos — phones, screens, obligations — you hand over your energy before you've even connected with yourself. But when you carve out space for stillness first, something shifts:

- **You respond instead of react** — meeting challenges from a centered place rather than a frantic one
- **Your intentions become clearer** — you move through the day with purpose, not just momentum
- **Stress loses its grip** — a grounded morning creates resilience that carries through the afternoon and evening
- **You remember what matters** — beneath the noise, your priorities become clearer

It doesn't have to be 25 minutes. Even 10 minutes of quiet presence before the world rushes in can be transformative. The key is consistency — making it a practice, not a one-time event.

## The Invitation

Tomorrow morning, before you reach for your phone, try this: sit up, close your eyes, and take five deep breaths. Then press play on the meditation above. Give yourself those 25 minutes before the day begins.

Notice how it feels to enter your morning from a place of stillness rather than stimulation. Notice how differently you respond to the first challenge of the day. Notice the space that opens up when you choose presence over productivity, even for a few minutes.

Your morning practice doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be yours.
