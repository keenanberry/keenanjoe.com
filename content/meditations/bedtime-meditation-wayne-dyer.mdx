## Setting the Tone for Sleep

Dr. Wayne Dyer offers a powerful reminder: the time before bed is sacred. It's when we set the tone for our sleep, a time when our subconscious mind marinates in whatever we feed it before drifting off.

In this teaching, Dr. Dyer introduces a meditation from U. S. Andersen's 1954 book *Three Magic Words*, centered on a simple yet profound affirmation: **"I am pure spirit."**

This practice invites us to release the struggle, to trust in the Universal Mind, and to recognize that the same intelligence that created the universe lives within us. It's a remembering — that we are not separate from the divine, but expressions of it.

## The Heart of the Practice

At its core, this meditation rests on several key affirmations:

> *"I know that I am pure spirit, that I always have been, and that I always will be."*

> *"There is inside me a place of confidence and quietness and security where all things are known and understood."*

> *"I give my problems to the great mind of God. I let them go, confident that the correct answers will return to me."*

These aren't just words — they're a shift in perspective. From struggle to trust. From separation to connection. From anxiety to the quiet confidence that you are held by something far greater than your individual concerns.

## Why This Matters

What we marinate in before sleep becomes the soil in which our consciousness rests through the night. Rather than taking our worries and to-do lists to bed, this practice invites us to:

- **Release the need to struggle** — trusting that answers come when needed
- **Remember our divine connection** — the intelligence that moves galaxies moves through us
- **See obstacles as illusions** — temporary, not ultimate reality
- **Rest in our true nature** — pure spirit, always perfect, always whole

This isn't about positive thinking or manifesting. It's about aligning with what's already true: that you are not just a body navigating a difficult world, but spirit itself, having a human experience.

## The Practice

Listen to Dr. Dyer guide you through this meditation. Let the words wash over you. Don't try to grasp or force anything — simply receive.

As you drift toward sleep, hold these affirmations gently. Let them be the last thing your conscious mind touches before surrendering to rest.

## An Invitation

Tonight, before bed, try this practice. Give yourself these few minutes to shift what you're bringing into your sleep. Notice how it changes not just your rest, but how you wake up and meet the next day.

This meditation captures something essential — a truth worth returning to again and again.
