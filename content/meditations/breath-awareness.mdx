## Returning Home Through Breath

The breath is always with us — a constant companion, a bridge between body and mind, a doorway to the present moment.

In this meditation, we explore the simple yet profound practice of breath awareness. No special technique is required. We're simply noticing what's already happening.

## The Practice

Find a comfortable position, either seated or lying down. Allow your eyes to close or soften your gaze.

Begin by noticing that you're breathing. Don't try to change anything — just observe.

> "Breathing in, I know I am breathing in. Breathing out, I know I am breathing out."

Notice:
- The cool air entering your nostrils
- The expansion of your chest and belly
- The natural pause between breaths
- The warm air leaving your body

## After the Practice

When you're ready, gently open your eyes. Take a moment before returning to your day.

Remember: this practice is always available to you. One conscious breath is enough to shift everything.
